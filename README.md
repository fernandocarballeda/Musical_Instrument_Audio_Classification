# Musical_Instrument_Audio_Classification

First of all, clone this GitHub repository in your local by running

``git clone https://github.com/fernandocarballeda/Musical_Instrument_Audio_Classification.git``

in your terminal, while you are in the directory you want the repository to get created. Go inside the folder and execute the following commands to create a conda environment and install the necessary libraries:

``conda create -n miac python=3.7``
``activate miac``
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## wavfiles

``wavfiles`` folder contains audios in .wav format of different musical instruments.

If we want to add more data to this folder we have to download from the Internet the audio in .mp3 format and, using FFmpeg converter, change its file type to .wav using this command in the terminal:

``C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg -i audio_name.mp3 audio_name.wav``

Here is some useful information on how to install this converter: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows

## clean.py

``clean.py`` script provides a set of tools for processing and cleaning the audio data.

It starts by splitting audios in ``wavfiles`` folder into smaller segments (1.0 seconds by default) and deleting those with no sound (a threshold can be specified to define what an audio with no sound is). Afterwards, the valid segments of audio are stored in ``clean`` folder divided again by musical instruments.

To execute this script, run the next command in the terminal:

``python clean.py``

you can specify different params like

``--delta_time`` to choose the time in seconds of the generated audios.

## models.py

This script contains the definition of the models we will train to try to perform a good classification of the audios. It contains some models from scratch and other pretrained ones. Feel free to include new models in order to get a better accuracy in the classification.

## train.py

This script is in charge of training the different models defined in the ``models.py`` script. It performas a train_test_split with the data contained in the ``clean`` folder.

By changing the ``model_type`` parameter we can choose the model we want to train, like this:

``python train.py --model_type lstm``

## logs

When a model is trained using the ``train.py`` script, a new file is generated in this folder, with information about the training and validation accuracy and training and validation loss for each epoch.
