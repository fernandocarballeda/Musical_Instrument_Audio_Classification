# Musical_Instrument_Audio_Classification

``wavfiles`` contains audios in .wav format of different musical instruments.

If we want to add more data to this folder we have to download from the Internet the audio in .mp3 format and, using FFmpeg converter, change file type to .wav using this command in the terminal:
``C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg -i audio_name.mp3 audio_name.wav``
